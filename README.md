## Folder Structure

To keep the repository organized, the following folder structure is used:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Course 1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Topic 1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Topic 2
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Course 2
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Topic 1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Topic 2
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each course has its own folder, and within each course folder, there are subfolders for each topic or concept covered in the course. This structure helps in easily navigating and locating specific coursework.

Happy learning!
